# Task Organizer Technical Architecture

## Overview

Task Organizer is a Flutter-based task management application that provides task organization, categorization, and analytics. It supports both online and offline modes, with cloud synchronization when connected to the internet.

This document outlines the technical architecture of the application, including its core components, data flow, and implementation details.

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern:

1. **UI Layer**: Contains the screens and widgets that make up the user interface
2. **State Management Layer**: Uses Provider for state management
3. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and external service interactions
4. **Data Layer**: Handles data persistence and retrieval

## Core Components

### 1. Models

The application uses the following data models:

#### Task Model

```dart
class Task {
  final String id;
  String title;
  String description;
  DateTime dueDate;
  bool isCompleted;
  Color categoryColor;
  String category;
  int priority;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime updatedAt;
  
  // Methods for serialization and manipulation
}
```

#### Category Model

```dart
class Category {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final Color color;
  
  // Methods for serialization and manipulation
}
```

### 2. State Management

The application uses Provider for state management:

#### TaskProvider

Manages the state of tasks, including:
- Loading tasks from local storage and Firebase
- Adding, updating, and deleting tasks
- Filtering tasks by completion status, date, etc.
- Syncing tasks with the cloud

#### CategoryProvider

Manages the state of categories, including:
- Loading categories from local storage and Firebase
- Adding, updating, and deleting categories
- Syncing categories with the cloud

#### ThemeProvider

Manages the application theme:
- Toggling between light and dark mode
- Persisting theme preference

### 3. Services

#### AuthService

Handles user authentication:
- Email/password authentication
- Google Sign-in
- Managing offline mode
- User state persistence

#### DatabaseService

Manages database operations:
- Interacting with Firebase Firestore
- CRUD operations for tasks and categories
- User-specific data management

#### SyncManager

Handles data synchronization:
- Syncing local data with Firebase
- Conflict resolution
- Sync status notifications

### 4. UI Components

The application includes the following main screens:
- Splash Screen
- Login Screen
- Home Screen (with task lists)
- Category Screen
- Task Detail Screen
- Analytics Screen
- Settings Screen

## Data Flow

### Task Creation Flow

1. User creates a task through the UI
2. TaskProvider adds the task to the local state
3. Task is saved to local storage (SharedPreferences)
4. If online, SyncManager syncs the task to Firebase
5. UI is updated to show the new task

### Data Synchronization Flow

1. User goes online after being offline
2. SyncManager fetches remote changes from Firebase
3. SyncManager compares local and remote data
4. Conflicts are resolved (newer version wins)
5. Local and remote data are synchronized
6. UI is updated with the latest data

## Offline Capability

The application uses a "local-first" approach:
1. All data is stored locally using SharedPreferences
2. Operations are performed on local data first
3. When online, data is synced with Firebase
4. The application works fully offline, with sync happening when connectivity is available

## Authentication

The application supports:
1. Email/Password authentication
2. Google Sign-in
3. Anonymous (offline) usage

## Security

1. Firebase security rules ensure users can only access their own data
2. Authentication tokens are securely stored
3. Sensitive data is not stored in plain text

## Error Handling

1. Network errors are caught and presented to the user
2. Retry mechanisms for failed operations
3. Graceful degradation to offline mode when connectivity is lost

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for business logic (services, providers)
2. Widget tests for UI components
3. Integration tests for key user flows

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for iOS platform
2. Desktop platform support
3. Advanced task filtering
4. Calendar view
5. Subtasks and checklists
6. Notifications and reminders
7. Additional authentication methods
8. Data export/import functionality
